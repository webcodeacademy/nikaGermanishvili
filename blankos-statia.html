                <h2>Fortnite Creator's Epic Games Store Launches First NFT Game</h2>

                <p>
                    
                    Blankos Block Party, an NFT-powered online creation game, launched today on the Epic Games Store, becoming the first Web3 title published on the popular PC gaming marketplace.
           
                    
                   <br> Mythical Games’ title was previously available from its own website after launching with an open beta in December 2020, and the company said in June this year that Blankos had amassed more than one million total users to date.
                    
                     <br> The studio announced plans in June to bring the free-to-play title to the Epic Games Store this year, but it was unclear whether it would be the first such game to reach the marketplace. Gala Games previously announced that its Western-themed shooter Grit would be first Web3 game on the platform, but its not yet available.

                     <br>Blankos Block Party lets users play and collaborate in a colorful online world, and is inspired by designer/vinyl toy culture. NFTs are used in the game to represent unique items like avatar designs and accessories, which can be bought and sold through the game’s marketplace. 

                    <br> Since launching, the game has brought in a number of brand and artist partners for limited-edition drops, including Burberry, Atari, and musician Deadmau5. However, owning NFTs is not required to play the game. An NFT is a blockchain token that represents ownership in an item, including video game goods like characters, weapons, and virtual land.
